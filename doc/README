WebIOPi is a web application which allow you to control your Raspberry Pi's GPIO. Just install it on your Pi, and use any browser from your network.

It's useful to start enjoying GPIOs and also to debug some circuits without writing any line of code.

It also allows to control your Pi's GPIOs over Internet, so it's a good starting point for home remote control.

You can even fully customize the included UI with few CSS modifications or use the REST API to build your own WebApp.

=Features=
   Support binary GPIOs, in both input and output.
   HTML / Javascript / CSS client side
   Easily [CUSTOMIZE] UI
   REST/JSON [WEBAPI]
   Server side available in several technologies
     PHP/Apache
     PHP/lighttpd
     Python
   Smartphone compatible
   Auto-refresh

=Restrictions=
   GPIOs 0 and 1 have input pull-up resistor enabled.
   UART is enabled but unusable for now.
     GPIOs 14 and 15 are disabled
   UART, SPI and I2C support will be added as soon as possible.
   Don't forget that GPIO support only 3.3V, don't plug them to 5V !!!

Check the [ROADMAP] for the upcoming features

=Usage=
First of all, follow [INSTALL] instructions.

If your are directly using your Raspberry Pi with keyboard/mouse/display plugged,  open a browser to http://localhost/webiopi/ Don't forget to add :port right after localhost if you use a different port.

If your Raspberry Pi is connected to your network, you can open a browser to http://raspberrypi/webiopi/ with any device of your network. Replace raspberrypi by its IP if DNS don't find raspberrypi. Don't forget to add :port right after raspberrypi/IP if you use a different port.

You can even add a port redirection on your router (and/or use IPv6) to control your GPIOs over Internet !

   Click/Tap the OUT/IN button to change GPIO direction.
   Click/Tap pins to change the GPIO output state.
