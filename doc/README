This page is being updated for the upcoming release. Please refer to the doc included in the WebIOPi 0.3 archive

WebIOPi is a web application which allows you to control your Raspberry Pi's GPIO. Just install it on your Pi, and use any browser from your network. Click/tap the in/out buttons to change GPIO direction, and click/tap on each output pin button to change their state. 

It's useful to start enjoying GPIOs and also to debug some circuits without writing any line of code.

It also allows to control your Pi's GPIOs over Internet, so it's a good starting point for home remote control.

You can even fully customize the included UI with few CSS modifications or use the REST API to build your own client.

WebIOPi has been developed on a Raspbian wheezy, but should work on others distribs.

=Features=
   HTML/Javascript/CSS client and Python server
   Supports binary GPIOs, in both input and output.
   Smartphone compatible
   Auto-refresh

   Easily [CUSTOMIZE] UI
   REST/JSON [RESTAPI]
   [JAVASCRIPT] helper API
   Server usable as a [PYTHON] lib

=Restrictions=
   GPIOs 0 and 1 have input pull-up resistor enabled.
   UART0 and I2C1 are enabled but unusable for now.
     GPIOs 2, 3, 14 and 15 are disabled
   UART, SPI and I2C support will be added as soon as possible.
   Don't forget that GPIOs support only 3.3V, don't plug them to 5V !!!

Check the [ROADMAP] for the upcoming features

=Usage=
If not already done, follow [INSTALL] instructions.

If your are directly using your Raspberry Pi with keyboard/mouse/display plugged,  open a browser to http://localhost/webiopi/ Don't forget to add :port right after localhost if you use a different port.

If your Raspberry Pi is connected to your network, you can open a browser to http://raspberrypi/webiopi/ with any device of your network. Replace raspberrypi by its IP and don't forget to add :port right after the IP if you use a different port.

You can even add a port redirection on your router (and/or use IPv6) to control your GPIOs over Internet !

   Click/Tap the OUT/IN button to change GPIO direction.
   Click/Tap pins to change the GPIO output state.

You can also use the expert app, which gives you an ordered list of GPIOs. It's located at http://localhost/webiopi/app/expert/ (or http://raspberrypi/webiopi/app/expert/)

You can also create you own server script, to fully customize the behavior, add computing... Check [PYTHON]  and [CUSTOMIZE] for more informations.
