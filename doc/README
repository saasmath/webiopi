WebIOPi 0.5 : Features, Usages

WebIOPi is a web application which allows you to control your Raspberry Pi's GPIO. Just install it on your Pi, and use any browser from your network. Click/tap the in/out buttons to change GPIO direction, and click/tap on each output pin button to change their state. 

It's useful to start enjoying GPIOs and also to debug some circuits without writing any line of code.

It also allows to control your Pi's GPIOs over Internet, so it's a good starting point for home remote control.

You can also [CUSTOMIZE create your own web interface] using the included [JAVASCRIPT Javascript library], or the [RESTAPI REST API]. And you can even use the WebIOPi power inside your own Python script using the [PYTHON Server Library].

WebIOPi has been developed on Raspbian wheezy, but should work on others distribs.

=Usage=
If not already done, follow [INSTALL install instructions].

If your are directly using your Raspberry Pi with keyboard/mouse/display plugged,  open a browser to http://localhost:8000/webiopi/

If your Raspberry Pi is connected to your network, you can open a browser to http://raspberrypi:8000/webiopi/ with any device of your network. Replace raspberrypi by its IP.

You can even add a port redirection on your router (and/or use IPv6) to control your GPIOs over Internet !

Default user is "webiopi" and password is "raspberry"

   Click/Tap the OUT/IN button to change GPIO direction.
   Click/Tap pins to change the GPIO output state.

You can also use the expert app, which gives you an ordered list of GPIOs. It's located at http://localhost:8000/webiopi/app/expert/ (or http://raspberrypi:8000/webiopi/app/expert/)

You can also create you own server script, to fully customize the behavior, add computing... Check the [PYTHON Python library] and [CUSTOMIZE customization page] for more informations.
