WebIOPi is developed and tested on Raspbian.

You only need Python, either 2.7 or 3.2. Download, then extract and install WebIOPi. The setup script will automatically download and install required dependencies using apt-get. You may have to manually install GCC and Python development headers if you are not using Raspbian.

$ wget http://webiopi.googlecode.com/files/WebIOPi-0.6.0.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf WebIOPi-0.6.0.tar.gz
$ cd WebIOPi-0.6.0
$ sudo ./setup.sh

Finally, run Python using webiopi command :
$ sudo webiopi [-h] [-c config] [-l log] [-s script] [-d] [port]

    Options:
      -h, --help           Display this help
      -c, --config file    Load config from file
      -l, --log file       Log to file
      -s, --script file    Load script from file
      -d, --debug          Enable DEBUG

    Arguments:
      port                 Port to bind the HTTP Server
 
You're done, and ready to enjoy WebIOPi ! But the server and GPIO state will be lost when you'll stop the script (CTRL-C) or close the terminal.

You can also start/stop the background service :
$ sudo /etc/init.d/webiopi start
and
$ sudo /etc/init.d/webiopi stop

You can even setup your system to start webiopi at startup :
$ sudo update-rc.d webiopi defaults


=Usage=
If your are directly using your Raspberry Pi with keyboard/mouse/display plugged,  open a browser to http://localhost:8000/

If your Raspberry Pi is connected to your network, you can open a browser to http://raspberrypi:8000/ with any device of your network. Replace raspberrypi by its IP.

You can even add a port redirection on your router (and/or use IPv6) to control your GPIOs over Internet !

Default user is "webiopi" and password is "raspberry"

By choosing the GPIO Header link on the main page, you will be able to control GPIO using a web UI which looks like the board header.
   Click/Tap the OUT/IN button to change GPIO direction.
   Click/Tap pins to change the GPIO output state.
