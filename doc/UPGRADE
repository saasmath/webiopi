==PHP==
Add a rewrite rule in /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf before the first webiopi rule :
url.rewrite += (
	"^/webiopi/(.)/$" => "$0", #add this line
	"^/webiopi/(.)\.(.+)$" => "$0",
	"^/webiopi/(.+)$" => "/webiopi/webiopi.php"
)

==Customized UI==
CSS naming has changed to to use GPIO number instead of RPi pin :
   customized apps go to app folder, each in a separate subfolder
   add the "../../" prefix in each script and link tag's src.
   #webiopi => #content
   added #RPiHeader for the header table
   #pin2 => #gpio0 and so on
   GND, 3.3V, 5V, and DNC pins are directly accessible, uses classes instead
   .pinDirectionEnabled => .DirectionEnabled
   .pinDirectionDisabled => .DirectionDisabled
   .pinName => .Description
