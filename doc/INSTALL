This page is being updated for the upcoming release. Please refer to the doc included in the WebIOPi 0.3 archive

You will need Python development headers. On Raspbian, open a terminal :
$ sudo aptitude install python-dev

Now download WebIOPi at http://code.google.com/p/webiopi/downloads/list

Then extract and install WebIOPi :
$ tar xvzf WebIOPi-X.Y.tar.gz
$ cd WebIOPi-X.Y
$ sudo ./setup.sh

Finally, run Python using webiopi module :
$ sudo python -m webiopi [port]
where port is the port to bind the HTTP server, default is 8000.

You're done, and ready to enjoy WebIOPi ! But the server and GPIO state will be lost when you'll stop the script (CTRL-C) or close the terminal session.

You can also start/stop the background service :
$ sudo /etc/init.d/webiopi start
and
$ sudo /etc/init.d/webiopi stop

You can even setup your system to start webiopi at startup :
$ sudo update-rc.d webiopi defaults
