The included REST API allows you to make you own client, using HTTP REST calls. You can you use it to achieve several tasks :
<wiki:toc maxdepth="3" />

Errors returned by the WebAPI are understandable when the HTTP call is not valid :
   400 Bad Request (path incomplete)
   403 GPIO # Not Available
   403 GPIO # Disabled
   404 `[something]` Not Found


=Get GPIO function=
   HTTP GET /GPIO/(gpioNumber)/function
     Returns "in" or "out"
   Example :
     To get GPIO 0 function : HTTP GET /GPIO/0/function

=Set GPIO function=
   HTTP POST /GPIO/(gpioNumber)/function/("in" or "out")
     Returns new setup : "in" or "out"
   Examples:
     To set GPIO 0 as input : HTTP POST /GPIO/0/function/in
     To set GPIO 1 as output : HTTP POST /GPIO/1/function/out

=Get GPIO value=
   HTTP GET /GPIO/(gpioNumber)/value
     Returns 0 or 1
   Example :
     To get GPIO 0 value : HTTP GET /GPIO/0/value

=Set GPIO value=
   HTTP POST /GPIO/(gpioNumber)/value/(0 or 1)
     Returns new value : 0 or 1
   Examples:
     To raise GPIO 0 : HTTP POST /GPIO/0/value/1
     To fall GPIO 1 : HTTP POST /GPIO/1/value/0

=Output bit sequence=
   HTTP POST /GPIO/(gpioNumber)/sequence/(delay),(sequence)
     Returns last bit
   Examples :
     To output a pulse on GPIO 0 with a 10ms delay : HTTP POST /GPIO/0/sequence/10,010

=Call a macro on the server=
   HTTP POST /macros/(macro)/(args)
     Returns the value returned by the macro

=Get full GPIO state/configuration=
   HTTP GET /``
     Returns full GPIO state in JSON :
{"UART0": 1, "I2C0": 0, "I2C1": 1, "SPI0": 0, "GPIO":{
"0": {"function": "IN", "value": 1}, 
"1": {"function": "IN", "value": 1}, 
"2": {"function": "ALT0", "value": 1}, 
"3": {"function": "ALT0", "value": 1}, 
"4": {"function": "IN", "value": 0}, 
"5": {"function": "ALT0", "value": 0}, 
"6": {"function": "OUT", "value": 1}, 
...
"53": {"function": "ALT3", "value": 1}
}}
"UART0": 1, "I2C0": 0, "I2C1": 1, "SPI0": 0 mean that both UART0 and I2C1 are enabled, whereas both I2C0 and SPI0 are disabled. So GPIOs used by UART0 (14 and 15) and I2C1 (2 and 3) are disabled and unusable.
