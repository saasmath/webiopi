You have the choice of the install, depending on your need and which technology you prefer : PHP or Pyhton.

*Don't use different server at the same time, or it may not work correctly.*
  * PHP version is good if you already have Apache/PHP on your Pi or if you plan to use it, but requires some configuration.
  * Python version is perfect for one time use,  or for users who don't want to install Apache and/or modify its configuration.

=PHP=
First install required packages. On Raspbian, open a terminal :
$ sudo aptitude install apache2 php5

In order to work, WebIOPi requires to allow .htaccess :
$ sudo nano /etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default
Find the <Directory /var/www/> section and change the line "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All" :
﻿  <Directory /var/www/>
﻿  ﻿  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
﻿  ﻿  AllowOverride All
﻿  ﻿  Order allow,deny
﻿  ﻿  allow from all
﻿  </Directory>
﻿  
You will also need to add Apache's user (www-data) to the sudoers :
$ sudo visudo
then add the following line at the end of file :
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Exit, save, confirm changes, and restart Apache :
$ sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

Now, download and extract WebIOPi :
$ wget http://webiopi.googlecode.com/files/WebIOPi-0.2.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf WebIOPi-0.2.tar.gz
Finally, move extracted files or create a symbolic link :
$ sudo mv webiopi /var/www
or
$ sudo ln -s webiopi /var/www/webiopi

You're done, and ready to enjoy WebIOPi !

=PYTHON=
You will need Python development headers. On Raspbian, open a terminal :
$ sudo aptitude install python-dev

Then download, and install RPi.GPIO module :
$ wget http://raspberry-gpio-python.googlecode.com/files/RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.tar.gz
$ cd RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a
$ sudo python setup.py install

Now download and extract WebIOPi :
$ wget http://webiopi.googlecode.com/files/WebIOPi-0.2.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf WebIOPi-0.2.tar.gz
$ cd webiopi

Finally, run the python script :
$ sudo python webiopi.py [port]
or
$ sudo ./webiopi.py [port]
where port is the port to bind the HTTP server, default is 80, but maybe used.

You're done, and ready to enjoy WebIOPi !
