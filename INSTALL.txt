You have the choice of the install, regards on wich technology you prefer : PHP or Pyhton.
But don't use different server at the same time, or it may not work correctly.
- PHP version is good if you already have Apache/PHP or if you plan to use it, but requires some configuration.
- Python version is perfect for one time use, or for users who don't want to install and/or modify Apache configuration files.

PHP
---
Requires Apache2 and PHP5 on you Pi, and also some tweaks :
First install required packages :
$ aptitude install apache2 php5
Then download and extract WebIOPi to /var/www

In order to work, PHP version of WebIOPi requires to allow .htaccess :
Edit /etc/apache2/site-enabled/000-default
and find the "<Directory /var/www>" section
then change the line "AllowOverride None" to "AllowOverride All" :
	<Directory /var/www/>
		Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
		AllowOverride All
		Order allow,deny
		allow from all
	</Directory>
	
You will also need to add apache's user (www-data) to the sudoers :
$sudo visudo
and add a new line with "www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL" at the end of file :
#includedir /etc/sudoers.d
pi ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
www-data ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL

Exit, save, and confirm changes.

You can now open a browser to http://raspberrypi/webiopi/  (or replace raspberrypi by your Pi's IP)
  

PYTHON
------
Requires RPi.GPIO module : http://pypi.python.org/pypi/RPi.GPIO/

You will need Python development headers
On Raspbian, with root user  (or using sudo):
$ aptitude install python-dev

Then download & install the GPIO module :
$ wget http://pypi.python.org/packages/source/R/RPi.GPIO/RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.tar.gz
$ tar xvzf RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a.tar.gz
$ cd RPi.GPIO-0.3.1a
$ python setup.py install

To install WebIOPi, just download and extract the archive wherever you want.
To run it, open a terminal in the directory you extracted WebIOPi, and start the server process with root/sudo : 
$ python webiopi.py [port]
or
$ ./webiopi.py [port]
where port is the port to bind the HTTP server, default is 80, but maybe used by Apache.

You can now open a browser to http://raspberrypi[:port]/ (or replace raspberrypi by your Pi's IP)


Refer to README.txt for information about WebIOPi usage.
